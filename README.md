# qmake-cpp11-boost

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/richelbilderbeek/qmake-cpp11-boost.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/richelbilderbeek/qmake-cpp11-boost)

C++ example project that uses qmake, C++11 and Boost, to compile and get to work with Travis CI.

Goal is to:

 * Compile with C++11 support, currently using `g++` only
 * Compile with the Boost libraries
 * Travis CI to check if it compiles correctly

# I want to add `clang` support

Awesome! Add an Issue, do a Pull Request or email me (if you'd prefer to be a Collaborator).
